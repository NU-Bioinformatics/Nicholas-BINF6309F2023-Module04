```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Methods

Perform differential expression analysis by estimating the relative abundance of transcripts and applying statistical models to test for differential expression between treatment groups. 

To estimate relative abundance we determine how many reads match a given gene within a genome using the program Salmon. Salmon is imported using tximport and then DESeq2 is used to perform statistical tests to identify differentially expressed genes. 


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
